# YelpInterfaceReviewStudy

Project done in collaboration between five students that all took part in running experiments and analyzing the results.

This usability study focused on evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness and learnability of the current Yelp interface.

This report was created for the Computer Science course, Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Methods (CPSC 344)
at the University of British Columbia.

The focus and goals of the study were definedby the group, as well as the experiment was run with two researchers at all
time for each individual. So, I ran some experiment sessions while I also developed the tasks for the experiment. 
Then based on the results I wrote the requirements section of the report. This project was done in collaboration with 
four other students, A.M, D.C, O.P and T.T.

The project was developed on the premise of analyzing an existing interface as a list of interfaces was provided to choose 
from.
